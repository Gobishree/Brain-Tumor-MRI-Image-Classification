# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Image-Classification
This project focuses on classifying brain tumor types from MRI images using deep learning techniques.
A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a transfer learning model based on MobileNetV2 were developed and compared.
The models classify MRI scans into glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor categories.
Image preprocessing and data augmentation were applied to improve model performance and generalization.
The best-performing model was deployed using a Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.
This system demonstrates how AI can support medical image analysis and assist in early diagnosis.
